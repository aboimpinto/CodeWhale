//! Type-ahead integrity across TUI startup (#5925).
//!
//! Startup asks the terminal three questions whose answers arrive on stdin —
//! the OSC 11 background query, the kitty graphics probe, and the sixel
//! primary-DA probe (see [`crate::palette::osc11`]). All three run after raw
//! mode is on and before the [`crate::tui::ui::TerminalInputPump`] exists, so
//! for that window Codewhale is the only reader of the tty. Anything the user
//! has already typed sits in the same buffer as the replies.
//!
//! Before this module the probe readers consumed those bytes and threw them
//! away: a `/plugin install …` typed at launch reached the composer as
//! `gin install …`, no longer began with `/`, and was submitted to the model
//! as a prose prompt (#5925).
//!
//! The contract now is: a probe reader keeps only its own reply and hands
//! every other byte it consumed to [`osc11::carry_typed_ahead`]. The event
//! loop replays that buffer, in order, into the same `pending` queue the input
//! pump feeds, before the pump is spawned — so replayed keys are delivered
//! ahead of anything still sitting in the tty. Bytes that cannot be turned
//! back into a key event (a control byte, an escape sequence, invalid UTF-8)
//! are never guessed at: they are named in an INFO receipt and recorded as
//! evidence that the shell did not see the whole line.
